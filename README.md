# Firefly Theming - Custom WordPress theme for Firefly Partners

This repo contains a from-scratch WP theme in progress for the purposes of a job interview with Firefly Partners. It's a basic theme currently able to handle a single-level main navigation and common content output, such as text, images, and shortcodes.

The CSS is handled via SASS files and I started using a BEM naming convention.
